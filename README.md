  program use standard sympols to write equation as:
  |sympol   |equalivent to    |
  |---------|-----------------|
  |'x+y'    |x plus y         |
  |'x-y'    |x minus y        |
  |'x*y'    |x multiply y     |
  |'x/y'    | x division by y |
  |'x^y'    | x <sup>y</sup>  |
  |'&#8730;(x)' |square root of x |
  |'&pi;'     | PI              |
